This is the third blog I've started, my earlier blogs (at [Blogger](http://paanini.blogspot.in)and [Tumblr](http://paanini.tumblr.com)) have been all but abandoned.

Blogger, I found to be too limited; the pre-built themes didn't allow a lot of customization, and try as I might, I couldn't find one that I liked. Tumblr is far more design conscious, has some great themes, but editing them can be a pain. Besides, it didn't strike me as a place for longform or text-based posts (which is what I'm looking for), so that ended quickly.

As someone who puts a great deal of thought into my software choices, I started looking around for some alternatives, and ended up trying [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and finally plain-vanilla Jekyll, which is what I've settled on.

Though both Bootstrap and Octopress are meant to simplify the process of setting up a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blog, they add too much fluff to the folder structure, and end up complicating the process significantly. Installing themes on Bootstrap is difficult, and Octopress required me to have access to a full development environment just to add a new post.

I decided to use plain-vanilla Jekyll, and desisted from using any fancy themes, choosing instead to tweak the [default theme](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to my liking. You can probably tell the theme is "custom" by taking a look at the source for this page - the CSS is really messy with lots of redundant tags. I'm afraid to clean it up now, fearing the site will probably break if I change anything. (Thank god it's versioned!)

This setup allows me full access to the site on a local Git repository on my Linux machine, and posting via [Prose.io](http://prose.io) through a browser if I'm on any other machine. (They also allow posting via mobile, but I haven't tried that out yet.)

I want to write more starting this year, so settings up this blog was the first step! Since I'm horrible at coming up with clever names, this blog won't have a name.

Happy New Year!
