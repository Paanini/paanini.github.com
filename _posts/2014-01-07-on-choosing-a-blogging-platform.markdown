This is the third blog I've started, my earlier blogs (at [Blogger](http://paanini.blogspot.in)and [Tumblr](http://paanini.tumblr.com)) have been all but abandoned.

Blogger, I found to be too limited; the pre-built themes didn't allow a lot of customization, and try as I might, I couldn't find one that I liked. Tumblr is far more design conscious, has some great themes, but editing them can be a pain. Besides, it didn't strike me as a place for longform or text-based posts (which is what I'm looking for), so that ended quickly.

As someone who puts a great deal of thought into my software choices, I started looking around for some alternatives, and ended up tring [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and finally plain-vanilla Jekyll, which is what I've settled on.

Though both Bootstrap and Octopress are meant to simplify the process of setting up a Jekyll blog, they add too much fluff to the folder structure, and end up complicating the process significantly. Installing themes on Bootstrap is difficult, and Octopress required me to have access to a full development environment just to add a new post.

This setup allows me full access to the site on a local Git repository on my Linux machine, and posting via [Prose.io](http://prose.io) through a browser if I'm on any other machine. (They also allow posting via mobile, but I haven't tried that out yet.)

I want to write more starting this year, so settings up this blog was the first step! Since I'm horrible at coming up with clever names, this blog won't have a name.

Happy New Year!
