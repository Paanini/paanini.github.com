Right off the bat, this [book](http://www.amazon.in/Hatching-Twitter-Nick-Bilton/dp/1444761951/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1391504704&sr=1-1&keywords=hatching+twitter) isn’t about Twitter, the product/website/app. In fact, the story of how the product matured over the years gets almost no mention in the book; particularly Twitter’s transition from an SMS based service to a smartphone app is completely absent.  Similarly, the stories behind the development of Twitter’s now-famous features such as the Retweet, Favourite or Direct Messaging are completely ignored, and Twitter’s biggest contribution to Internet speak, the #hashtag gets very little mention.

What this book covers amply, are the ever-changing relationships between the co-founders, early employees and investors. In minute detail, Nick Bolton talks about the internal conflicts, power struggles and boardroom coups that led to Twitter changing CEOs thrice in three years.

Viewed as the story of its founders rather than the story of Twitter itself, the book is a glorious read. The book opens with Evan Williams starting Blogger, the hugely popular blogging platform that was later acquired by Google, and then drifts onto the slow rise and early demise of Odeo, co-founded by Evan Williams and Noah Glass. When it became apparent that Odeo (a podcasting service that never really took off) was doomed, Jack Dorsey, an engineer at Odeo at the time, started working on a site that would let people share status messages via SMS. Twitter was born.

Twitter’s impact on mainstream media, and its growth as a tool used to spread news, spark revolutions, and let celebrities engage with their audiences is covered extensively. Ashton Kutcher beating CNN to become the first Twitter account with a million followers, signing up Oprah on her show, and delaying maintenance on Twitter’s servers so citizens of Syria could use it to voice their protests are some of the highlights.

All in all, it’s gripping enough to force you to complete the book. I loved the scenes with Mark Zuckerberg where he tries to buy Twitter (twice), only to be turned down. The writing is brilliant in these parts – so wonderfully awkward and tense, but hilarious to the reader.  (The chapter is titled “[Accidental Billionaires](http://www.amazon.in/Accidental-Billionaires-Betrayal-Founding-Facebook/dp/0099551233/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1391504737&sr=1-1&keywords=accidental+billionaires)” which is what I’m going to be reading next!). Another amusing takeaway from the book is the quote

which was put up at the Twitter office, hung upside down. It's whimsical, yet optimistic and uplifting - I love it!

If you have more than a passing interest in startup culture or the web, pick it up, it’s a good read.
